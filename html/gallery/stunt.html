        <h1>Stunt Triple: Hollywood Hero Gallery</h1>
        <p>A small showcase of work I did for my university game production project, Stunt Triple: Hollywood Hero.</p>
        <br>

        <div class="grid">

            <!-- Early Moodboards -->

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Protagonist concept sketches</h3>
                <p>
                    Some early concept sketches of what the main hero could look like. Made without intention of being final, simply to set the tone for a more finalized design.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Protagonist concept design</h3>
                <p>
                    An unused design for the main protagonist, mostly scrapped simply due to time constraints. This course was during a summer semester, and time was a limited resource,
                    so unfortunately this design didn't get to make the final cut.
                </p>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Western enemies designs</h3>
                <p>
                    Enemies designed for the western level. Due to time constraints, we weren't able to fully implement enemies with different designs from one another,
                    though the idea behind them was that every area would have a burly melee enemy and a scrawny ranged enemy.

                <h3>Title screen and logo</h3>
                <p>
                    Title screen art featuring the protagonist's main key art, the game's finalized logo, and a background all done by me.
                    Due to the limitations of the class, I was also tasked with baking the title screen's button text into the menu art.

                <p>
                    A few miscellaneous hand-drawn in-game screens (from left to right, top to bottom: intro cutscene, level select, game over, and ending).
                    These, like the title screen and key art, also use the newer design based on the in-game model.
