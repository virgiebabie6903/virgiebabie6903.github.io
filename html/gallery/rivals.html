        <h1>Rivals of Aether Workshop Gallery</h1>
        <p>
            A collection of characters and stages I created or helped to create for Rivals of Aether's user-run Steam workshop.

            You can click on each entry's picture to be brought to their Steam workshop page.

                <h3>Wario (March 2023)</h3>
                <p>
                    A ground-up remake of my first ever Rivals mod created in 2021, and my first character I would deem properly "good".

                    While the base sprite and some animations are heavily inspired by Wario's sprite from Legend of Starfy 3, many of his attacks
                    are new animations meant to replicate the orignal style and adapt it to Rivals.
                    
                    This was also my first time expanding on moveset design, in which I tried to give Wario more synergy and interaction with the Wario Bike, famous from its appearance in Super Smash Bros.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Yoshi -->
            <div class="grid-item full">
                <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3499356885" target="_blank"><img src="../../assets/image/rivals/yoshi-roa-new.png"></a>
            </div>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Yoshi (June 2025)</h3>
                <p>
                    Not quite as fancy or unique as Wario, more or less a standard port of Yoshi from Super Smash Bros. However, the art is all original,
                    with the base sprite being primarily based on Yoshi's Island DS with some notable pose and proportional differences.
                    <br><br>
                    Yoshi was also my first proper attempt at an animated trailer, which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwK8giz4cGI" target="_blank">here</a>.
