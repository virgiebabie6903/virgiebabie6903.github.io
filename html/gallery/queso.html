        <h1>Queso Caper! Gallery</h1>
        <p>A showcase of the 2D and 3D work I did for my UCF game production project, Queso Caper!
            <br><br>
            The prompt of the assignment was to make a 30-second game featuring a hallway with a guard.
            My group initially proposed the idea of Plankton stealing the formula from Mr. Krabs, but we then remembered that copyrighted content
            was probably not the way to go, so I quickly designed a new set of characters to give off the idea of a small protagonist getting past a big antagonist,
            while still keeping the initial cartoony premise in tact.

                    The most tried-and-true "small thief" type of character is a rat, so that's what I immediately tried for when designing the characters for this game.
                    I went out of my way to make him look a bit goofy, though, as to not appear mean or antagonistic.
                    <br><br>
                    When my teammates asked me for a name, I named him Rupert on the spot for no particular reason.

                <p>
                    To keep the initial concept in tact, we wanted Rupert to be infiltrating a kitchen, with this cleaver-wielding chef as its guard. His face is intentionally smushed
                    and his hands are intentionally simplified, as we were on a time crunch through the whole semester and I didn't want to give ourselves more work than necessary.
                    <br><br>
                    I am responsible for his name too, Chef Kitzencinque (pronounced "Kitchen Sink". It's French, probably).

                <h3>In-game models</h3>
                <p>
                    For this project, I was also responsible for modeling, rigging and animating the main characters, as well as the collectible cheese. For the sake of time and consistency,
                    I worked in Blender, and thankfully was able to adapt the models from the concept sketches smoothly. If our project were more ambitious, the models would likely look a bit
                    cleaner, but for our cartoonish aesthetic and overall scope, these were perfectly fine for getting the job done.

                <p>
                    This was my first time doing fully-rendered art for menu screens. In this one in particular, I tried to replicate the style of
                    cartoon title cards (minus the Comic Sans font, that was just there because our team was running short on time and I didn't want to draw each individual letter).
                    <br><br>
                    These drawings of Rupert tried to be more faithful to his final model than the original sketches, which had more centered eyes and a better defined neck.
                    I am particularly proud of how the shading on these pieces came out.
