        <h1>Gabe Gator in: Gator Crossing Gallery</h1>
        <p>A small showcase of work I did for a solo game art project at UCF, Gabe Gator in: Gator Crossing.</p>
        <br>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Gabe Gator concept art</h3>
                <p>
                    Some prelimiary sketches I created when trying to decide on the tone and style of my game art class project.
                    I landed on an ironically meek and timid alligator character named Gabe who lives in the sewers of New York,
                    and intentionally gave him cooler, less aggressive colors, softer points and a smaller stature to help convey
                    his general demeanor.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Pack Concepts -->
            <div class="grid-item full">
                <img src="../../assets/image/gator/Rat_Pack.png">
            </div>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Rat Pack concept art</h3>
                <p>
                    Naturally with a hero character, the game needs enemies, which gave me the idea for rat hooligans that rule the sewers Gabe lives in.
                    To align with the New York vibe, I also made a not-yet-used ranged variant based on a mafia member.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Cheese Concepts -->
            <div class="grid-item full">
                <img src="../../assets/image/gator/Big_Cheese.png">
            </div>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>Rat Pack concept art</h3>
                <p>
                    The assignment also called for a main antagonist, so I decided to give the aforementioned rat pack a proper leader. He's a very standard big bad
                    for this style of platformer, but I'm proud of his design nonetheless.
                    <br><br>
                    Fun fact: the name "Big Cheese" was actually suggested by my mom when I was telling her about the assignment as I was working on it. Thank you, mom.
