                    A solo project done for a game art class at UCF. Though the main focus was on the art, animation and concept art,
                    I also used my knowledge of coding in Game Maker Studio 2 to create a quick and dirty but satisfying to control
                    platformer in the process.

                    collectible models and animations.

                    motion capture for the first time, serving as the choreography director for our animation session.
